Experts do not foresee a housing market crash looming in 2024, as lending standards are stricter now compared to before the Great Recession. With low inventory and high demand persisting, the housing market is not expected to enter a recession in the upcoming year. However, prospective homebuyers may find it challenging to purchase a house in 2024 due to relatively high mortgage interest rates and limited housing inventory. If mortgage rates decrease, it could make purchases more affordable for buyers and potentially encourage existing homeowners with lower rates to sell, thereby increasing market inventory.

Sources for these views include the National Association of Realtors, S&P Dow Jones Indices, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and insights from industry experts like Lawrence Yun. These sources provide data and analysis on existing-home sales, consumer price index, pending home sales, and forecasts for the housing market, contributing to the consensus that a housing market crash is not imminent in 2024, despite the challenges posed by high mortgage rates and low inventory levels.
